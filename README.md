deeplink-tester-Android
===================

Simple App to test deeplinks on Android. It does two things:

1. Its main Activity claims the scheme 'deeplinktest' so that you can use this App to test deeplinks by calling deeplinktest://. When opened from a deeplink the App will display the deeplink that was used.
2. Test which deeplinks are working on the current device. The App will test if there is an Activity answering to a deeplink as you type in the input box.

This is an Eclipse project.
